==Components==
* 2 standard sets of components implemented via taglibs
    - Core (abrivated "f", namespace=http://java.sun.com/jsf/core) = Render agnostic components
        Usually represents behaviour/object you can attach to components (the targetwe attach objects to is known as the
        "parent component"). Typically we attach:
            = Attributes: Key/value map stored/accessable in the parent 
            = Parameters: List of values stored in a specific child component inside a parent
            = Converters: 
            = Validators:
            = Listeners:
            = Facets: Add nested components to parent
            = Select items:
    - HTML (abrivated "h", namespace=http://java.sun.com/jsf/html) = Renders HTML

===Core Components===
* <f:view>: Create toplevel view
    - Restrictions: only one <f:view> pr JSF page
    - Attributes:
        = locale: Set locale for this view
* <f:subView>: Create a subview. 
    Commonly used to reuse parts of a page. Prefered method over frame as frames makes bookmarking hard (and generates seperate
    HTTP requests)
    - Restrictions: Included pages must not contain a <f:view>.
    - Attributes
        = id: uniquely identify this component within the scope of enclosing  naming container.
    - Example
        ----
        <f:subview id="header">
            <c:import url="header.xhtml"/>
        </f:subview>
        ----
