 * Demonstrates order of initialization, static blocks goes first in the order
 * they are listed in followed by initialization of any instance variables (in
 * this case blocks of code) finally followed by the constructor.
 * 
 * Notice that the static and initialization blocks are not able to use
 * instance/static variables declared after them, mirroring the behavior found
 * inside in a method where everything must be defined before its use (but
 * unlike the method concept inside a class where method B can call method C
 * defined after it)
 * 
 * Notice how if you run make multiple instance of the class then static blocks
 * are only executed once in the same class loader
