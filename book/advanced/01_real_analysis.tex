The discovery of calculus by eighteenth century mathematicians, notably Newton
and Leibniz, was largely due to increased understanding of the behavior of real
functions. The birth of analysis is often traced to the early nineteenth century
work of Cauchy, who gave precise definitions of concepts such as continuity and
limits for real functions. Convergence problems while approximating real
functions by Fourier series gave rise to both the Riemann and Lebesgue
integrals. Cantor developed his set theory in an effort to answer uniqueness
questions about Fourier series
