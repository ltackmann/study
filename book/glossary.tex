\glsentry{associativity}{operation is associativ if within
an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same
associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed
does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.}

\glsentry{axiom}{}

\glsentry{cohort}{A group of subjects who have shared a particular
event together during a particular time span (e.g., people born in Europe
between 1918 and 1939; survivors of an aircrash; truck drivers who smoked
between age 30 and 40)}

\glsentry{commutativity}{Commutativity operation is commutative if
changing the order of the operands does not change the result.}

\glsentry{constant}{a number, term or expression that doesn't change. If
$y = x + 7$ then 7 is a constant. The area of a circle equals $2\pi r$ where
$r$ is the radius (a variable), and $\pi$ is a constant.}

\glsentry{factor}{a number or expression that divides exactly into
another number or expression. 1,2 and 5 are factors of 10; x and (2x + 3)
are factors of 2x2 + 3x because x multiplied by (2x + 3) = 2x2 + 3x.}

\glsentry{fraction}{a number such as 1/2, 2/3, 17/2. Can also be written
with a horizontal line, eg . The number above the line (called the
numerator) is divided by the number below the line (called the
denominator).}

\glsentry{irrational number}{A number that is not rational, eg $\pi$,
Euler's number e.}

\glsentry{linear equation}{A algebraic expression, usually of the form
\[
ax = b
\]
in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and
(the first power of) a single variable (that is no variables in the
expression contains exponents, like the $2$ in $x^2$, square roots,
cube roots, etc.)}

\glsentry{measure}{A measure on a set is a systematic way to assign a
number to each suitable subset of that set, intuitively interpreted as
its size. In this sense, a measure is a generalisation of the concepts
of length, area, and volume}

\glsentry{QED}{\emph{Quod erat demonstrandum}, Latin for
\emph{which was to be proved}}

\glsentry{rational expressions}{A expression
involving fractions of polynomials such as $\frac{x-1}{x^2 + 12}$.}

\glsentry{rational number}{A number that can be made by dividing one
integer by another, eg 1/2, 5/7, 12/108, 12/1.}

\glsentry{real number}{the normal numbers we use, including decimals,
fractions, integers, negative numbers, positive numbers, irrational
numbers, etc. They are called real because they aren't complex numbers
(numbers that involve the square root of -1)}

\glsentry{square}{the square of a number is the number multiplied by
itself, eg 5 squared = 52 = 25}

\glsentry{square root}{the square root of a number is a number that when
multiplied by itself gives the original number. The square root of 36 is
6. The square root symbol is , so .}

\glsentry{statement}{\emph{If P, then Q}, where its
\textbf{converse} has the following form: \emph{if Q, then P}}

\glsentry{term}{}

\glsentry{variable}{a quantity that may change, eg the circumference of a
circle equals 2πr where π (pi) is a constant and r, the radius, is a
variable.}
