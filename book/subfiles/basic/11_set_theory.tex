\section{Sets}
A indexed set is a collection of values associated with indices. For example

\begin{itemize}
\item An ordered pair is a family indexed by the two element set $2 = \{1, 2\}$.
\item An n-tuple is a family indexed by $n$.
\end{itemize}

the set that whose members label (or index) members of a family is called an index set.
