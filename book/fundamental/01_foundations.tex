"A bat and ball, together, cost a total of $1.10$ and the bat costs $1$ more than the ball. How much is the ball?" The wrong answer is the one that roughly one in every two people blurts out: 10 cents. The correct answer is 5 cents, since only with a bat worth $1.05$ and a ball worth $5$ pence are both conditions satisfied.
