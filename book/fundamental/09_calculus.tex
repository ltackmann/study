If I'm driving at a constant velocity, say 60 km per hour, the distance I travel is changing in a constant manner, ie every hour I cover 60 km. We can say the rate of change of the distance I travel with respect to time is constant. However, if my car is moving with constant acceleration, its velocity is changing in a constant manner, but the distance I travel is not changing constantly - because I'm accelerating. We can say the rate of change of the distance I travel, with respect to time, is not constant.

\section{Differential calculus}
Differential calculus allows us to find the exact slope of a curve, in other words a function's rate of change, at any particular point. We are assuming that the function is differentiable in the first place and that the gradient doesn't go shooting off to infinity.
\[
\frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
\]
is known as the difference quotient, or the Newton quotient, and its limit defines the derivative of a function.


\subsection{The derivative}
This limit is known as the derivative and is the heart of differential calculus. In this example, where $y = x^2$ the derivative could be denoted by
\[
\frac{dy}{dx}
\]

\[
f(x) = x^k 
f'(x) = kx^{k-1}
\]

\subsubsection{the product rule}
We use this rule when differentiating a product of two or more functions.

\subsubsection{the chain rule}
The chain rule This rule is used if a function is a function of another function. So, if y is a function of u and u is a function of x, then the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to the derivative of y with respect to u multiplied by the derivative of u with respect to x,

\section{Integral calculus}
For example, say we have a function that tells us the acceleration of an object after a certain time. If we can integrate that function we obtain a new function that tells us the velocity of the object after a certain time. If we integrated the second function, we'd get a third function that tells us the distance covered after a certain time. But we can also do that sequence of calculations in reverse, by starting with the function that tells us distance covered after a certain time. We can differentiate that function to find the object's velocity and differentiate again to find its acceleration.

\section{Series}

\subsection{Taylor series}
\begin{equation}
cos(\theta) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n \cdot \theta^{2n}}{2n!}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Geometric Series}
\begin{equation}
a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}ar^k = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}
\end{equation}

\section{Special functions}
\subsection{Logarithm}
A logarithm (log or logs for short) goes in the opposite direction to a power by asking the question: what power produced this number? So, if 2x = 32, we are asking, ‘what is the logarithm of 32 to base 2?’ We know the answer: it's 5, because 25 = 32, so we say the logarithm of 32 to base 2 is 5. In general terms, if , then we say the logarithm of a to base x equals p, or For example, 104 = 10,000, so we say the logarithm of 10,000 to base 10 equals 4, or We can take logarithms of any positive number, not just whole ones. So, as 103.4321 = 2704.581 we say the logarithm of 2704.581 to base 10 equals 3.4321, or Logarithms to base 10 are called common logarithms. Older readers may remember, many years ago - after the dinosaurs, but before calculators and computers were widely available - doing numerical calculations laboriously by hand using tables of common logarithms and anti-logarithms. The properties of logarithms are based on the aforementioned rules for working with powers. Assuming that a > 0 and b > 0 we can say: logx(ab) = logxa + logxb, eg log10(1000 × 100) = log10(100,000) = 5 = log10(1000) + log10(100) = 3 + 2. logx(1/a) = -logxa, eg log3(1/27) = -log327 = -3. logx(a/b) = logxa - logxb, eg log2(128/8) = log2(16) = 4 = log2(128) - log2(8) = 7 - 3. logx(ay) = ylogxa, eg log5(253) = log515,625 = 6 = 3 × log525 = 3 × 2. 1.8.3

\subsection{Natural logarithm}

Say we invest 1 in a bank that pays 100\% interest per year. If the bank calculated and credited the interest at the end of one year, our investment would then be worth $1 + 1 = 2$. But if the bank credits the interest more frequently than once a year say every six months, at the end of that period the balance would equal $(1 + 1/2)$ since we would get half of the yearly interest payed each six months. At the end of one year the total amount would be $(1 + 1/2)(1 + 1/2) = (1 + 1/2)^2$ as the interest (compund or basic). Calculated three times a year after four moths we would have $(1 + 1/3)$ after eight $(1 + 1/3)^2$ and the final balance would be $(1 + 1/3)^3$. In general, if interest is calculated n times a year, the balance after one year is
\[
f(k) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right)^k
\]
if we plug in some values we observe
\[
\begin{align*}
  f(2)  =& \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 2.25 \\
  f(5)  =& \left(1 + \frac{1}{5}\right)^5 = 2.248832 \\
  f(10) =& \left(1 + \frac{1}{10}\right)^{10} = 2.59374...
\end{align*}
\]

n 
1 2 
2 2.25 
3 2.37037 
4 2.44141 
5 2.48832 
10 2.59374 
100 2.70481 
1000 2.71692 
100,000 2.71827 
1,000,000 2.71828 
10,000,000 2.71828

We can see that as n increases, the value of the function appears to settle down to a number approximately equal to 2.71828. It can be shown that as n becomes infinitely large, it does indeed equal the constant e. The mathematically succinct way of saying this introduces the important idea of a limit and we say where means the limit of what follows (ie ) as n approaches infinity (symbol ). In other words, e approaches the value of as n approaches infinity.

\begin{equation}
e = \lim_{k\to\infty}\left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right)^k
\end{equation}

\subsection{The exponential function}
% TODO plot y=e^x
The exponential function f(x) = ex, often written as exp x (see Figure 1.7) arises whenever a quantity grows or decays at a rate proportional to its size: radioactive decay, population growth and continuous interest, for example. The exponential function is defined, using the concept of a limit, as
