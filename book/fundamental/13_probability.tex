% “law of large numbers,” a major result in the theory of probability. The law of large numbers gives the precise mathematical result that corresponds to the well-known fact that the relative frequency of an event will more accurately predict the likelihood of its occurrence the more trials you observe.

Probability theory is the basis on which statistics and with it a many of mathematics most useful applied subjects rest uppon. The ability to calculate probabilities transformed statistics from mere data collection to using data to make informed decisions. Today politicians try to predict voter behaviour through opionen polling. Marketing departments study customers to figure out how best to launch new products and in medicine statistics is used to compare the benefits drugs with their risks.

\myindent In spite of their obvious usefulness, probability and statistics are rather new branches of matematics. Some of the earlist studies of probability comes from gambling. In the sixteenth century Gerolamo Cardano\index{Gerolamo Cardano} demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favorable to unfavorable outcomes. Later these ideas was picked up and expanded upon by Pierre de Fermat\index{Pierre de Fermat} and Blaise Pascal\index{Blaise Pascal}. In recent years the study of probability and statistics has gained pace as computers allows us to perform studies on ever larger samples.

\myindent In 1494 Luca Pacioli\index{Luca Pacioli} first published the challange that let Pascal and Fermat to undertake the formal study of probability. The challange is known as the problem of the unfinished game. Suppose two players $\{A, B\}$ bets on who will win the best of five tosses of a fair coin, but then have to stop before either player has won. How do they divide the pot?. If each has won the same number of throws then the pot is split evenly. But what if they stop after three tosses, with player $A$ ahead $2\text{-to-}1$?. Pacioli, suggested that the solution is to divide the pot according to the current state of play, namely $2\text{-to-}1$. But in $1539$ Cardano demonstrated that this is incorrect as splitting the pot depended not on how many rounds each player had already won but on how many each player must still win in order to win the contest. To see this consider that as $A$ is ahead $2\text{-to-}1$, the first three rounds must have yielded two heads and one tail. The remaining two throws can yield $\{H,H\}$, $\{H,T\}$, $\{T,H\}$, $\{T,T\}$. In the first scenario $\{H,H\}$, the final score is four heads and one tail, so player $A$ wins; in the second and the third ($\{H,T\}$ and $\{T,H\}$), the final outcome is three heads and two tails, so again player $A$ wins. Only in the fourth scenario with $\{T,T\}$ is the final outcome two heads and three tails, so player $B$ wins. This means that player $A$ wins in three of the four possible ways the game could have ended and thus the pot should be divided $3/4$ for $A$ and $1/4$ for for $B$. 

\section{Probability of events}
\epigraph{"I can as easily throw one, three or five as two, four or six. The wagers there are laid in accordance with this equality if the die is honest."}{\textup{Gerolamo Cardano}, Liber de ludo aleae (Book of Games of Chance)}

In the quote above Cardano states that with a fair die the probability of getting $\{1,3,5\}$ is the same as getting $\{2,4,6\}$. He thus formulated one of the earlist known examples of the probability of an event as a fraction: the number of events that meets a constraint (such as a die being even or odd) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (such as the six different faces of a die). 
\begin{equation}\label{prob:simple-event}
P(event) = \frac{\text{Number of events that meet constraint}}{\text{Number of equally likely events}}
\end{equation}
For example a toss of a fair coin have two possible outcomes $\{H,T\}$ so the probability of heads is $P(H) = 1/2$. Semilarly a toss of a fair die has $6$ possible outcomes $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ so the probability of the die showing six is $P(6) = 1/6$. Events described this way are called are simple events\index{Simple event} as they consists of exactly one outcome. For example, tossing a coin is a simple event, but rolling a die and tossing a coin is a combination of two simple events and is therefore a compound event\index{Compund event}. Cardano next tackled these by observing that the probability of getting a certain outcome on two successive throws is the square of the probability of getting it on a single throw. For example, the probability of getting a $6$ twice is $1/6 \times 1/6 = 1/36$. Similarly, the probability of getting three even numbers is $1/2 \times 1/2 \times 1/2 = 1/8$ (this assumes that is the events are \index{Independent event}independent events, i.e. that the first throw does not influence the second). That is the probability of two independendt events $A$ and $B$ both occuring is
\begin{equation}\label{prob:compound-event}
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
\end{equation}
With compound events the likelihood of a series of independent events occurring is the multiplication of the likelihood of each individual event. So, if the probability of you finishing this chapter is $9/10$, and the probability of you finishing the next one is also $9/10$, then the total probability of you finishing both chapters isn't $9/10$ but instead $9/10 \times 9/10 = 81/100$. Note if you remove the restriction on the order in which the events occures then there are more possibilities. For example, the probability of rolling a $6$ followed by an even number is $1/6 \times 1/2 = 1/12$ but without the restriction of order it becomes $5/36$. The easist way to see this is to count all the possible outomes of throwing two dies $6 \times 6 = 36$ and then count the number of favorable outcomes (the die is even or six) $\{2,6\}$, $\{6,2\}$, $\{4,6\}$, $\{6,4\}$, and $\{6,6\}$. As there are five such outcomes we arrive at $5/36$. 

\myindent Cardano next considered examples where we are interested in any of two \index{Mutually exclusive event} mutually exclusive events. That is two events that cannot occur at the same time, such as getting heads and tails on the same coin flip i.e $P(H \text{ and } T) = 0$. He observed that given
\begin{equation}\label{prob:exclusive-event}
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
\end{equation}
So the probability of getting one or six is $P(1 \text{ or } 6) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3$ and probability of even number as $P(even) = P(2 \text{ or } 4 \text{ or } 6) = 3/6$ and the odds of getting a $1$ or an even number are $1/6 + 3/6 = 2/3$. 

\myindent Finally Cardano’s also calculated the probability of throwing a $1$ or a $2$ with a pair of dice. The probability of throwing a $1$ or a $2$ with a single die is $1/3$, so the naive answer would be that with two dice the probability is $2/3$. Cardano observed this was incorrect as the probability of not rolling $1$ or $2$ with a single die is $4/6 = 2/3$, so the probability of not rolling it with two dice is $2/3 \times 2/3 = 4/9$. Hence the probability of rolling a $1$ or a $2$ must be $1 - 4/9 = 5/9$. This last scenario is a example of complementary event\index{Complementary events}. Complementary events are events that when add together to equal a whole. 
\begin{equation}\label{prob:complementary-event}
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
\end{equation}
Here $P(A^c)$ means the complement of event $A$. For example, if the probability of it raining today were $2/5$, the probability of it not raining would be $1 - 2/5 = 3/5$. 

\subsection{Conditional probability}
From Cardano's early results and Fermat and Pascals' study of the unfinished game it was made clear that probabilities functioned very differently based on the nature of the events studied. In $1657$ the dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens\index{Christiaan Huygens} published his \textit{De ratiociniis in ludo aleae} ("On Reasoning in Games of Chance") in which he studied dependent events\index{Dependent events} and conditional probability\index{Conditional probability}. Conditional probability is the probability of an event happening given that another event has occurred. Formally we write $P(B|A)$ meaning "the probability of event B given event A"
\begin{equation}\label{prob:conditional-event}
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)
\end{equation}
For example if we have $2$ blue and $3$ red marbles in a bag, then the chance of getting a blue marble is $2/5$. But after removing one marble the chances change. If we got a red marble then the chance of picking a blue now is $2/4$, but if we got a blue then the chance of getting another is $1/4$. Thus the probability of drawing two blue marbles is 
\[
P(\text{first blue}) \times P(\text{second blue}|\text{first blue}) = 2/5 \times 1/4 = 1/10
\] 
Note if we replace the marbles in the bag each time with new ones so there are always $2$ blue and $3$ red marbles, then the chances do not change and the events become independent

\myindent The most famous problem of conditional probabilities is likely the \index{Monty Hall problem}Monty Hall problem. At the last round of a game show, you’re faced with three curtains. Behind one there is a car but behind the two others there is a goat. You’re asked by the presenter to make a first choice. He then reveals one of the curtains you haven’t chosen which contains a goat. The presenter then offers you a chance to change your mind and switch curtain. Should you switch your choice or stick to the origiginal one. To most peoples surprise the correct answer is that you should switch your choice after being given this additional information. To see this consider the following table of posible actions
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{door 1} & \textbf{door 2} & \textbf{door 3} \\ \hline
stay            & switch          & switch          \\ \hline
switch          & stay            & switch          \\ \hline
switch          & switch          & stay            \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
that is if the car is behind dore one and you chose door one you should stay, if you chose door two or three you shoukd switch, equally for door two and three. From this table its easy to count that you should swich $6$ out of $9$ times which is therefor the best strategy.

\section{Random variable}
\subsection{Expected return}
% TODO http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_return
Expected gain is generally regarded as the correct objective measure (in most cases) of the value of a particular wager to the person who makes it. To compute it, you multiply the probability of each outcome by the amount that will be won (or lost, which you count as a negative gain) and add all the results together. For example, casinos offer even odds for betting on red or black at roulette. Suppose you bet $100$ on red. The roulette wheel has 36 slots, numbered from 1 to 36, half of them colored red, half black, and two zeros, colored green. The probability of red coming up is therefore 18/38, that is, 9/19. So your expectation (to the nearest cent) is: (9/19 × 100) + (10/19 × -100) = -100/19 = -5.26 This means that if you play repeatedly, betting 100 on red each time, then on average, you will lose 5.26 on each game. To put it another way, you can expect your losses to average 5.26 a game.

\section{Probability space}
A probability spaces is a way to models processes consisting of states that occur randomly. For example in a deck of 52 cards the sample space is a 52-element set, as each card is a possible outcome. Since there can be many outcomes (even infinitely many), outcomes elements are grouped into sets which are called "events. For our deck of cards, possible events may include
\begin{description}
\item [- The 5 of Hearts] (1 element),
\item [- A King] (4 elements),
\item [- A Face card] (12 elements),
\item [- A card] (52 elements).
\end{description}
More formally an event, is any subset of the sample space we like to consider in our model, including the empty set (an impossible event, with probability zero) and the sample space itself (a certain event, with probability one).

\noindent To sum up a probability space consists of three parts
\begin{itemize}
\item The sample space $\Omega$ which is a set of all possible outcomes.
\item The $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ which is a collection of the events we would like to consider.
\item The probability measure $P$ which is a function returning an event's probability $P: F \rightarrow [0,1]$.
\end{itemize}

For example if the experiment consists of just one flip of a perfect coin, then the outcomes are either heads or tails: $\Omega = {H, T}$. The $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F} = 2^{\Omega}$ contains $2^2 = 4$ events, namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{H\}$ – "heads"
\item $\{T\}$ – "tails",
\item $\{\}$ – "neither heads nor tails"
\item $\{H,T\}$ – "either heads or tails"
\end{itemize}
So, $\mathcal{F} = \{\{\}, \{H\}, \{T\}, \{H,T\}\}$. Since there is a fifty percent chance of tossing heads, and fifty percent for tails the probability measure in this example is $P(\{\}) = 0, P(\{H\}) = 0.5, P(\{T\}) = 0.5, P(\{H,T\}) = 1$.

\subsection{Random variable}
A random variable (or stochastic variable) is a variable whose value is subject to variations due to chance. A random variable's possible values might represent the possible outcomes of a yet-to-be-performed experiment

The mathematical function describing the possible values of a random variable and their associated probabilities is known as a probability distribution. Random variables can be discrete, that is, taking any of a specified finite list of values; or continuous, taking any numerical value in an interval.
