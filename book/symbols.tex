 is equal to, eg 6 = 6. ≈ is approximately equal to, eg π ≈ 3.14. ~ is very approximately equal to, eg 2 ~ 5. ≠ is not equal to, eg 12 - 3 ≠ 7. + plus, eg 13 + 56 = 69. - minus, eg 13 - 3 = 10. × times or multiplied by, eg 2 × 13 = 26. Another way of saying the same thing is that 26 is the product of 2 and 13. ÷ or / divided by, eg 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5 or 7/2 = 3.5. ± plus or minus, eg 5 ± 2 = 7 or 3. < is less than, eg 5 < 10. is much less than, eg 0.12 1,000,000. > is greater than, eg 6.3 > 5.9. is much greater than, eg 30,000 0.5. is less than or equal to. is greater than or equal to. ∝ is proportional to, eg if y = 7x then y ∝ x. In other words, if x is doubled then so is y. the square root of, eg . ! factorial, eg 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720. implies that, eg x = 5 3x = 15. infinity - think of a big number. Infinity is bigger than that. absolute value, eg . B a two or three dimensional vector. Cartesian unit basis vectors. a unit vector in the radial direction. a four-vector. a one-form. Δx a small increment of x derivative, eg if y = x2 then . partial derivative, eg if z = x2 + xy2 then . integral, eg . 1.3
