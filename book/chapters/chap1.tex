"A bat and ball, together, cost a total of £1.10 and the bat costs £1 more than the ball. How much is the ball?" The wrong answer
is the one that roughly one in every two people blurts out: 10 pence. The correct answer is 5 pence, since only with a bat worth
£1.05 and a ball worth 5 pence are both conditions satisfied.12
