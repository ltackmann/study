Each exercise is numbered in accordance with the chapter where it is to be found and thus exercise $2$ in chapter $1$ is referenced as $1.2$.\\ 

%% BASIC CHAPTER
\ans{ex:analysis:1} Realizing that $2^n = (1 + 1)^n$ gives 
\[
(1 + 1)^n = \binom{n}{0}1^n + \binom{n}{1}1^{n - 1}1 + \cdots + \binom{n}{n - 1}1*1^{n - 1} + \binom{n}{n}1^n
\]
and since 1 to any power is 1, we get the desired result.

Let L*M=N =n1+10n2, L(k1+10k2)=n1+10n2

L*k1-n1=10a É.(1)

-10Lk2=10a-10n2, Lk2=a-n2

n2 ÐLk2=a É (2)

add one to two and by N=M*L

we find ((n1+10n2)(k1-k2)+ (k1+10k2)(nn-n1))/(k1+10k2)=11a, then (n2k1-k2n1)=0 (mod M)
